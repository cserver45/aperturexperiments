`service` refers to `Aperture Experiments discord bot`
`owner` refers to the person running the bot (which is `(insert name here)`)

We here at the Aperture Experiments development team respect your Privacy.
By using this service, you grant us access to store your discord user id.

__Why we store your discord user id:__
When you use our service, (specifically the economy system) we need something to link you to your progress when using this service.
If we didn't store this data, we could not have services like the economy system (as an example).

__How to remove/request your data:__
DM the owner of the bot (or the maintainter of the bot)
Then explain what you want to me removed/requested.

We reserve the right to change this at any time, without notice
