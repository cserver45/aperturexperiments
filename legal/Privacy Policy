`service` refers to `Aperture Experiments discord bot`

We here at Aperture Experiments development team respect your Privacy.
By using this service, you grant us access to store your discord user id.
Server owners, you grant us to store your server's discord id by using this service.

__Why we store your discord user id:__
When you use our service, (specifically the economy system) we need something to link you to your progress when using this service.
If we didn't store this data, we could not have stuff like the economy system (as an example).

__Server owners: Why we store your server id:__
Your server id is needed to link your server with the specified prefix/other settings you have setup/changed.
Otherwise, we could not have the option for the prefix to change on a per-server basis.

__How to remove/request your data:__
Join the support server (https://discord.gg/S55S9J4Y3p) and dm/ping one of the users under the role `Aperture Experiments Developers`.
Then explain what you want to me removed/requested.
In the future there might be a ticket system for this to make this more automated.

We reserve the right to change this at any time, without notice
